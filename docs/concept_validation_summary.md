# Concept Validation Summary

## Validation Objective
Confirm that the FieldPulse Diagnostics concept delivers measurable value for cybersecurity consultants by evaluating prototype desirability, feasibility, and monetization acceptance.

## Methods
1. **Lightweight Survey (n = 24)**
   - Distributed via email to prior interviewees and adjacent contacts.
   - 10-question Google Form covering pain severity, feature appeal, and willingness to pay.
2. **Prototype Feedback Sessions (n = 5)**
   - 30-minute moderated walkthrough of a Figma prototype illustrating the guided playbook, session dashboard, and export wizard.
   - Participants interacted via screen share; think-aloud notes captured in Dovetail workspace `VAL-2025-03`.

## Key Findings
### Desirability Signals
- 83% of survey respondents rated the guided diagnostics playbook as "very valuable" or "critical" for standardizing client engagements.
- Prototype testers highlighted the cross-platform parity (Android/iOS) as a unique differentiator compared to their current macOS-only workflows.

### Feasibility Feedback
- Participants validated that sideloading via enterprise MDM or AltStore is an acceptable trade-off provided clear instructions and entitlement templates are supplied.
- Offline-first requirements were confirmed; two respondents emphasized the need for cryptographic verification of exports before uploads.

### Monetization Insights
- 62% of survey respondents indicated willingness to pay $79â€“$119 USD per seat per month, assuming compliance bundles and support SLAs.
- Interest in analytics add-on strongest among MSSPs who manage multiple concurrent client sites.

## Adjustments Informed by Validation
- Prioritize building automated entitlement validation and MDM deployment scripts for iOS to reduce onboarding friction.
- Expand export module scope to include SHA-256 checksum manifest and PGP-based signing for audit trails.
- Include quick-start templates tailored for common compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, SOC 2) within the initial release.

## Outstanding Validation Tasks
- Run remote usability testing with non-native English speakers to ensure playbook copy clarity.
- Quantify performance impact of simultaneous WiFi scans and VPN diagnostics on mid-tier Android hardware.
- Pilot monetization experiment with tiered pricing to refine per-seat vs. per-client billing options.

## Next Steps
1. Schedule follow-up prototype iteration incorporating entitlement automation concepts (target: 2025-03-28).
2. Launch in-app instrumentation during alpha to capture conversion from trial to paid add-ons.
3. Prepare compliance advisor briefings summarizing legal guardrails for WiFi metadata storage in EU/APAC regions.
